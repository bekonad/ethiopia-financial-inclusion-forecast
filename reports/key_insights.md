### Key Insights from EDA

1. **Slowdown in access growth**: Account ownership increased +3pp only from 2021 to 2024 (46% → 49%), despite massive mobile money registration — indicates low activation/usage.

2. **Persistent gender gap**: Women at 42% vs men 57% in 2024 (~15pp gap unchanged since 2021) — structural barriers (literacy, phone ownership, norms) remain.

3. **Mobile money growth but active usage low**: From 4.7% (2021) to ~19.4% (2025 est.), but NDPS highlights only ~15% active — registered vs active gap is critical challenge.

4. **Digital payments lag access**: Only 21% made/received digital payment in 2024 — P2P dominance, limited merchant acceptance, low trust/utility.

5. **Infrastructure as leading indicator**: Mobile connections 68.4% and internet 21.7% in late 2025 correlate strongly with access growth — but affordability/digital literacy bottlenecks persist.

6. **Event impact potential**: NDPS (Dec 2025) and IPS launch expected to boost usage significantly (high magnitude, 12-month lag) — interoperability key.
